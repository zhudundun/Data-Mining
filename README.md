### HW 3 Frequent Pattern Mining 

Given a transaction dataset, implement the following algorithms.

A frequent pattern mining algorithm (e.g., the Apriori algorithm or FP-Growth) to extract the frequent itemsets.

A closed pattern mining algorithm to extract the closed itemsets.

A maximal pattern mining algorithm to extract the maximal itemsets.   




### HW 4-1 Decision Tree Classifier

Build a decision tree classifier for multi-class classification with continuous feature/attribute values. Binary split and a threshold are used to split data. The only stopping criterion is max tree depth.
