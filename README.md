### HW 3 Frequent Pattern Mining 

Given a transaction dataset, implement the following algorithms.

A frequent pattern mining algorithm (e.g., the Apriori algorithm or FP-Growth) to extract the frequent itemsets.

A closed pattern mining algorithm to extract the closed itemsets.

A maximal pattern mining algorithm to extract the maximal itemsets.   




### HW 4-1 Decision Tree Classifier

Build a decision tree classifier for multi-class classification with continuous feature/attribute values. Binary split and a threshold are used to split data. The only stopping criterion is max tree depth.



### HW 4-2 Naive Bayes Classifier
Build a naive bayes classifier for Zoo Animal Classification dataset from the UCI Machine Learning dataset.

### HW 5 Gaussian Mixture Models
Implement the gaussian mixture model algorithm using geographical data. Each of the data points is a 2-D vector, with longitude and latitude as its dimensions. Find the final cluster belongingness of every point in the input. 

In the initial EM step, initialize w=1/n where n is the total number of data points. And, initialize covariance matrix to be an Identity matrix. The initial mu for each cluster are given in the input.
